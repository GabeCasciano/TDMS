## To-do 
- [ ] Need to add Root object and propreties to the TDMS file.
- [ ] Need to write Root, MetaData and ChannelData on first write. 
- [ ] Ensure that the correct tocMask is being used for subsequent writes. 
- [ ] Ensure that files are closed off correctly

- I want to switch to the header generation stuff from structs to classes so I can do some oop to simplify the data generation portion.
- Now ... is that pythonic? idk...
- I should name space my TDMS stuff to keep it safe
